# Preface

Additive modeling algorithms are an essential part of the machine learning modelerâ€™s 
tool kit when working with tabular data. Such predictive models have excellent
intrinsic interpretability and often have optimal or near optimal performance.
While linear additive models are the most common type of additive models, and they often
have optimal performance, there are also many cases where additive functions need 
more flexibility.

To address this need we have developed the Model Sculpting method for building 
additive models. This is a model building pipeline that starts from developing
a strong learner, such as boosted trees, and then extracts an additive model that
best approximates the strong learner, thereby providing a more interpretable model
with limited cost in performance. 

The [slide deck](/assets/additive_model_slide.pdf) below provides an overview of the Model Sculpting method and its
applications. The [`modsculpt` R package](https://github.com/Genentech/modsculpt) provides an implementation of the method
and the [example workflow](https://genentech.github.io/modsculpt_example/) demonstrates
how to use the package to build an additive model.
