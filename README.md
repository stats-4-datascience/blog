## Building Locally

This site uses `quarto` (a successor to `rmarkdown`). If you're running on a
recent version of `RStudio`, chances are you already have it installed.

If you don't have it installed, you can follow [`quarto`'s installation
instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

Once installed, you can run the shell command `quarto preview` in the project's
root directory to build a local version of the website which will auto-update
after saving changes.
